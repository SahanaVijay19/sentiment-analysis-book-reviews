# Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews using Feed Forward Neural Networks
In this project repo, I have documented my entire process of implementing a sentiment analysis model to predict whether a book review is positive or negative.

In summary, I have developed a sentiment analysis model on book reviews using Feedforward Neural Networks in Keras. I applied text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization. I leveraged libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling and visualization. I conducted model selection and performance evaluation using loss and accuracy metrics. Essentially, I executed the full CRISP-DM lifecycle and documented the entire workflow and findings on this GitHub repo.

This project is really important to me because this is the first end-to-end project I've done independently as an early career ML professional. Please refer to my project repo's Jupyter notebook if you are interested in my thought process, analysis, and implementation.
