# Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews using Feed Forward Neural Networks

In this project repo, I have documented my entire process of implementing a sentiment analysis model to predict whether a book review is positive or negative.

In short, I have developed a sentiment analysis model on book reviews using Feedforward Neural Networks in Keras. I applied text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization. I leveraged libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data handling and visualization. I conducted model selection and performance evaluation using loss and accuracy metrics. Essentially, I executed the full CRISP-DM lifecycle and documented the entire workflow and findings on this GitHub repo.

I am an AI/ML Fellow at Break Through Tech, and this project was the final lab submission for my Machine Learning Foundations course (offered in collaboration with Cornell Tech). This project is very important to me because this is the first project I've done end-to-end and independently as an early career ML professional. Please refer to my project repo's Jupyter notebook if you are interested in my thought process, analysis, and implementation.
